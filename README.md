## Conclusion

Well i have spent 3 hours of my time on this..Now I am stopping..
Anyway.. I think there is enough progress here for you to see what I was trying to do..

- most of the work is in server.js..
- did't get to do too much JQuery fun..but eh!!
- had some issues getting user profile from the curl command , I even tried postman..no joy, it just kept saying 'Not Authorized', hmm just like Gandolf "You cannot Pass!!", Sarwan was preety pissed off!! :-)
- anyway these things happen..

Signing off, Michael Adebisi
